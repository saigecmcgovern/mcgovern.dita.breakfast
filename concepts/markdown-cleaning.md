#Cleaning up
##What to do with the food
All leftover food scraps, egg shells, fruit peels, etc. can be tossed directly into the garbage. Anything that is not trash-worthy can be wrapped in plastic wrap or a plastic baggie (both can be found in the drawer under the microwave) or placed in a tupperware container (located under the sink with the cooking utensils. They can all be placed in the refrigerator.
##What to do with the dishes
###Plastic dishes
Plastic dishes can be rinsed out and placed on the top rack of the dishwasher.
###Metal or glass dishes
Metal or glass dishes can be rinsed out and placed on the bottom rack of the dishwasher.
###Starting the dishwasher
Add one cascade (or other brand) detergent pod, close the dishwasher, and hit the "Normal" cycle button. It will run for about 40 minutes.
##What to do with the rest
###Counters and Stove
There is a large spray bottle of 409 in the cabinet next to the refrigerator. Soak the counters in this and use a rag (also found in the cabinet) to wipe it up.
###Trash
Take out the trash when you are done, the dumpster is located behind my building next to the tennis courts.
