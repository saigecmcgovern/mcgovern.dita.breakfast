# Where to find the food

When making any of these recipes, please note that all items are fully stocked and available in the kitchen. Here you will find the location of all of these items.

##Dairy products
All dairy producs can be found on the main shelf of the refrigerator. 
###Juice
Juice is also located here.
##Fruits
All fruits can be found in the bottom drawer of the refrigerator, labeled "fruits".
###Tomatoes
Technically, tomatoes are a fruit. They are, however, located with the vegetables in the "crisper" drawer for this meal.
##Vegetables
All vegetables can be found in the bottom drawer of the refrigerator, labeled "crisper".
##Dry goods
Any dry goods, like bread or flour, are in the second cabinet on the right above the stove.
##Materials
All materials like bowls, knives, whisks, or cocktail shakers are in a large plaster container under the sink. Don't ask me why, I just thought it would be convenient to have them all in one place.
