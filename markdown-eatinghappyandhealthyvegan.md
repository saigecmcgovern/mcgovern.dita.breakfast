#Eating Healthy and Happy

##The logic behing these meals
In this breakfast guide, I have chosen foods that all work together to provide you with a great
   start to the day. Eggs provde high quality protein as well as a variety of vitamins and minerals,
   and pancakes and english muffins can fill you with enough carbohydrates to sustain your energy
   levels throughout the day. It can never hurt to throw in a few vegetables, and while your body is
   important, it's just as important to have a good time, so I decided to include a recipe for a
   bloody mary to get you a few veggies and a slight buzz. To top it all off, there is a recipe for
   a simple fruit salad to round out the food groups. I hope you enjoy these recipes and feel
   healthy and happy by the end of your meal!
